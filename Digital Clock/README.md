# Real-Time Digital Clock

This is a simple Python-based digital clock application that displays the current time in real-time using the Tkinter library for the GUI and the time module to fetch system time. The clock updates every second to ensure accuracy and provides a clear, user-friendly interface.

## How the Clock Works

- The application retrieves the current system time in hours, minutes, and seconds format.
- The clock display automatically updates every second to reflect the correct current time.
- The time format used is 24-hour by default (you can modify it to 12-hour format if needed).
- The displayed time is styled for easy readability and provides a dynamic user experience.

## Requirements

To run the application, ensure you have the following:

1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. The Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with Python's standard library.
3. A basic knowledge of running Python scripts in your development environment.

- No additional dependencies are required. Simply run the script to start the digital clock!
